# ECSE-222-Digital-logic

Lab 1: Getting Started with VHDL Coding

• Run the IntelQuartus software 

• Create the framework for a new project

• Design and perform functional simulation of a Binary-to-7-segment LED decoder circuit 

• Design a 5-bit adder using VHDL

• Test the adder on the Altera board


Lab 2: Describing Sequential Circuits in VHDL

• Design a counter in VHDL

• Perform functional simulation of the counter using ModelSim 

• Design a stopwatch measuring time at every 10 milliseconds 

• Test the stopwatch on the Altera board


Lab 3: Finite State Machines

• Design an FSM for a counter

• Perform functional simulation of the FSM using ModelSim 

• Test the FSM on the Altera board
